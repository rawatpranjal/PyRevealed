# Changelog

## [0.5.9] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Performance page rewritten into concise paragraphs; consolidated RTD plot generation under `docs/perf/` with a CLI (`python -m docs.perf.cli`) and migrated legacy script to delegate. Figures write to `docs/_static/perf_*.png`.

### Fixed
- **Base install safety** — `import prefgraph` no longer crashes without `pandas`. Four dataset loaders (_retailrocket, _rees46, _taobao, _tenrec) had bare `import pandas as pd` at module level; now lazily imported via wrapper functions in `datasets/__init__.py`.
- **compute_mpi() function API** — was silently returning 0.0 on GARP-violating data. Root cause: Rust call had wrong argument count (missing `network=False`), causing TypeError caught by bare `except`, falling to Python fallback which had a separate `is_garp` gate bug. Fixed arg count per engine.py call signature. Ref: Echenique, Lee & Shum (2011) JPE 119(6), Eq. (2).
- **Engine VEI** — `Engine(metrics=['vei'])` returned `vei_mean=1.0` on inconsistent data. Neither the Rust backend nor the Python fallback called `compute_vei()`. Added Python VEI computation to both paths. Ref: Varian (1990) J. Econometrics; Mononen (2023) "Computing Measures of Rationality".
- **BehavioralAuditor HM** — `summary().houtman_maks_result` was `None` on consistent logs. Now always computed (fast-exits trivially with fraction=0.0). Ref: Heufer & Hjertstrand (2015) "Consistent Subsets".

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **VEI objective sign** — `compute_vei()` LP was maximizing sum(e_i) instead of minimizing, trivially returning e_i=1.0 for all observations regardless of GARP violations. Now uses direct R constraints and minimize direction, producing meaningful per-observation efficiency scores. Ref: Varian (1990) J. Econometrics; Smeulders et al. (2014) ACM Trans. Econ. Comp.
- **HM greedy SCC** — `_houtman_maks_greedy()` used `find_sccs(R)` (direct relation) instead of `find_sccs(R_star)` (transitive closure). Purely transitive GARP violations produced all-singleton SCCs, causing the greedy FVS to return 0 removals even when violations existed. Ref: Houtman & Maks (1985); Smeulders et al. (2014) Theorem 5.1.
- **Production GARP** — Python `test_profit_maximization()` checked `R_star[i,j] AND R_star[j,i]` (cycle only) instead of `R_star[i,j] AND P[j,i]` (proper GARP condition). Now matches the Rust implementation. Ref: Varian (1984) Econometrica; Chambers & Echenique (2016) Ch 15.
- **EngineResult defaults** — `is_harp`, `utility_success`, `hm_consistent`, `hm_total` now default to `None` (not `False`/`0`) when not computed. DataFrames show NaN instead of misleading failure values.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Python fallback engine now computes HARP and utility_success (were always False without Rust)

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-28

Re-release of 0.5.5 with multi-platform wheels (Linux manylinux2_28, macOS x86+arm, Windows, Python 3.10–3.13). v0.5.5 only shipped a macOS cp311 wheel.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Houtman-Maks ILP rewritten** — replaced Afriat Big-M formulation (broken: M too small, λ bounds infeasible) with Demuynck & Rehbeck (2023) Corollary 2. Uses fixed parameters α, δ, ε with clean data-derived bounds. Exact on all tested counterexamples.
- **Engine now uses exact ILP** for T ≤ 200 (`houtman_maks_exact`), greedy FVS for T > 200. Previously always used greedy, which over-removed observations.
- **HARP severity dropped** — `max_cycle_product` always returns 1.0. HARP is a binary test per Varian (1983) and Chambers & Echenique (2016, Thm 4.2); no severity metric is defined in the literature. Previous implementations (FW diagonal, 2-cycle patch) were approximations of a non-existent quantity.
- **Python HM ILP** — same Big-M fix as Rust (lambda bounds, M computation)

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- `validate_consistency` docstring referenced non-existent `is_valid` and `inconsistencies` fields — now correctly documents `is_consistent` and `violations`
- Install command in quickstart and README changed from `pip install prefgraph` to `pip install "prefgraph[datasets]"` — beginners no longer hit missing pandas on first run
- HM (Houtman-Maks) in Python fallback returned `hm_consistent=0, hm_total=0` — now computes real values
- `EngineResult` docstring described `hm_consistent / hm_total` as "noise fraction" — corrected to "rationalizable fraction"

### Added
- `HoutmanMaksResult.efficiency` property — returns fraction of rationalizable observations (`1 - fraction`), matching the polarity of `compute_menu_efficiency().efficiency_index`
- User_id note in quickstart — clarifies that `analyze()` output has `user_id` as DataFrame index

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `rp.analyze()` one-liner API — auto-detects long, wide, and menu formats from a DataFrame
- **Parquet streaming**: `rp.analyze("data.parquet", ...)` and `Engine.analyze_parquet()` — stream datasets larger than RAM with bounded O(chunk_size) memory
- **Rust-native Parquet pipeline**: `analyze_parquet_file()` reads Parquet, groups by user, and feeds directly to Rayon — eliminates Python from the hot path (requires `--features parquet`)
- `prefgraph.io.ParquetUserIterator` — streaming row-group reader for wide and long formats
- `prefgraph.io.prepare_parquet()` — sort and rewrite datasets for optimal streaming
- `nan_policy` parameter ("raise"/"warn"/"drop") for `analyze()` and `BehaviorLog`
- `load_pakistan()`, `load_favorita()`, `load_taobao()` dataset loaders
- 6-dataset e-commerce benchmark: 162K users, 14 tasks, RP features add 0–0.7% AUC
- LLM benchmark v2 Stage 1: 3,750 decisions, per-vignette SARP pass rates 60–100%
- Smart error messages with fuzzy column-name suggestions and type-conversion hints
- Python 3.13 wheels for all platforms
- Rust build now optional for source installs — pure-Python fallback via setuptools-rust

### Fixed
- Linux/Windows install broken — v0.5.2 only shipped macOS wheel

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- Front page hero GIFs redesigned as single-panel narrative animations with breathing gaps

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- PyPI homepage URL now points to ReadTheDocs instead of GitHub
- Linux CI: pin to Python 3.10-3.12 (PyO3 0.22 max), install libclang for HiGHS bindgen
- Escaped pipe characters in RST list-tables causing Sphinx build errors

### Changed
- Front page hero GIFs redesigned: single-panel narrative animations (14s each) replacing 3-panel 34s versions
- Budget GIF walks through violation detection → CCEI measurement with concrete axis labels (Apples/Oranges)
- Menu GIF uses concrete items (Laptop/Tablet/Phone) instead of abstract A/B/C letters
- Front page text rewritten in plain English; removed jargon from intro and "Why RP?" sections
- Added GIF captions explaining what each animation shows, with citations
- Simplified pipeline diagram to plain English with function names

### Added
- `load_demo()` synthetic dataset — 100 consumers, zero setup, deterministic
- `EngineResult.summary()` and `MenuResult.summary()` methods
- Field-level documentation for `EngineResult` and `MenuResult` dataclasses
- Quickstart page in documentation
- "Which API?" guidance in README
- Application pages: grocery rationality, LLM alignment, recommender systems
- Animated algorithm visualizations (Floyd-Warshall, SCC Tarjan, engine throughput)
- Hero images for budget and menu analysis pages
- Stock images for application pages
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### Changed
- README reordered: quick example first, architecture details moved to docs
- Documentation navigation restructured into data-type subdirectories
- Single-word nav tab names (Budgets, Menus, Algorithms, Performance, etc.)
